# myAgro Data Analytics Project
This repository contains the colab notebook my team and I used to perform our analytics project. **Contributors include Xinyi (Esme) Li, Paul Seiters, Tripti Sharma, and Shu Wang (Alex).**

**Problem Definition:**
1. Our project goal is to improve myAgro's sales and farmers' yields by analyzing key variables and comparing high-yield groups with low-yield ones. We believe this is an important because our insights could help myAgro provide better services and improve sales strategy to empower smallholder farmers.
2. The motivation behind our project is to help myAgro bring financial stability to farmers and provide easier access to necessary farming resources.

**Data Source Description:**
The data is based on myAgroâ€™s data warehouse, which documents transaction-specific and geographic information. The dataset contains 4 CSV files: client, harvest, package, and payment, where each file has more than 2,000 rows and 20 columns. In particular, the harvest table only contains a sample of clients who participated in myAgro's harvest measure activities, so it has fewer rows compared to the rest.

**Report Summary:**
To achieve our goal, we analyzed the following issues for our final project:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis: We merged key tables and selected important variables from them to conduct our analysis. Visualization of null values in our dataset helps me determine that missing values are randomly distributed, so there is no pattern.
2. Part I: Analyzes how crop yield differs across types, countries, seasons, etc. Data visualization also reveals how yield is impacted by gender among clients. Such initial analysis will provide myAgro with insights into how yield and sales change over time, and focus on certain client groups.
3. Part II: Performs geo-analytics to visualize village distribution and area for future market expansion. Analysis on high-yield villages helps myAgro understand the relationship between high yields in the previous year and sales in the next year to make informed decisions. Trainings provided to clients are also evaluated based on customer ratings, and myAgro's training quality received high recognition from farmers.
4. Finally, we made recommendations for myAgro to implement referral programs, experiment with intercropping methods, and adopt integrated data collection system to improve future sales and enhance farming yields.
